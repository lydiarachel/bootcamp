        <p>Hi there! My name is Lydia Velasquez.  It is my second day, I sound like a mouse, but I am super excited for every part of class and what we are learning.
        </p>
        <p>I am originally from Ohio.  I moved to Brooklyn, NY to be a pop star, which obviously didn't pan out.  I have been a flight attendant, worked at a record label, and now I work for a health insurance company.
